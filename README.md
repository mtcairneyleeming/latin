# LatinLearning
This has 3 components:

- **database**: a .Net Core class library containing definitions and the like for the database, which uses sqlite3
  - this previously contained functionality to decline Latin nouns (and in theory other parts of speech), but that has been abandoned
- **cli**: a small cli for loading data about Latin words into the database, sourcing the data from Wiktionary, either via its API or the data dumps
- **learning-gui**: a .Net Core console app, using [gui.cs](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs) for a small app that you can use to learn, and check your progress on Latin vocabulary, learning a word's meaning, declension/gender if it has one, and identifying or recalling its forms, either from Latin to English or vice versa

To use:
1. create a folder _LatinLearning_ in $HOME/AppData (or wherever `Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)` is on your system), that contains two json files, `checkboxData.json` and `filesCache.json`. This is also where the database is stored, but a new file is auto-generated by sqlite3 on first run
2. run `dotnet database update --start-project ../learning-gui/learning-gui.csproj` in the `database` folder, which creates all the tables in the database
3. run `dotnet run -- load pages` in the `cli` project to source data from a wiktionary dump (which you can find [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiktionary/latest/) that needs to be in the current directory as `wikidata.xml`
4. use `build_and_pack.ps1` in `learning-gui/build_helpers` to create an executable of the learning app, which you can now use.
    1. if you want to do this on another computer, just copy the generated .exe and the whole `LatinLearning` directory to the other computer. There is currently no way to synchronise progress across computers, so just use one
